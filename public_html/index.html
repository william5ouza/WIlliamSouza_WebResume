            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    
        <p>I have been <span>Nurse</span> since 2011, but in 2019 I decided trying to do something I had dreamt before going to study Nursing.</p>
            <p><span>TO BECOME A PROGRAMMER</span></p>
            <p>Curiosity has brought me to programming. My main interest is in mobile.</p> <p>I would say,<span> Android </span>  specifically, is my favourite programming language because it allows more freedom as a developer.</p>
            <p>I also feel up to learn front-end and web-design as web-pages are more attractive when they have nice designs.</p>
            <p>In a near future, I plan to upgrade my programming skills by doing different courses in the area and perhaps change my professional area, although merging both skills are my current plan</p>
